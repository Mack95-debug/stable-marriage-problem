# Stable Marriage Problem in Scala


Attempting the SMP in Scala. 

## Run

```bash
$ scala main.scala
```

## TODOS

- better naming standards, especially for type declarations
- better control flow, using case classes to maintain the state machine
- smaller functions? one large chunk of code makes people uneasy
- recursion? is there a better way to handle this (tailrecursion etc)?
